## Running Locally

Setup Convex & Clerk Development environments.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values from Clerk & Convex.

Run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the following commands (simultaneously) to start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
pnpm convex dev
```

The application is now running at `http://localhost:3000`.
